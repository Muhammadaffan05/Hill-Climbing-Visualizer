This repository demonstrates the implementation and optimization of the different hill climbing algorithms across various problem spaces, enhancing both efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, it features an integrated visualization module using the TURTLE library, allowing users to observe the optimization process in real-time and gain insights into the algorithm's behaviour.

"jupyter notebook preferred"

Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.11.2
- `turtle` library
- `numpy` library

You can install the required libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install 3.11.2  
pip install turtle
pip install numpy
